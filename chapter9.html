      <h2>Usability testing</h2>
	  <p>
	   Any testing with anyone is better than no testing, and a bit of testing earlier is better than a lot of testing later. Test with three or four users each round, and test for more than one round to catch new problems. Use a screen recorder during user tests to easily share and review them later. It doesn't much matter whom you test with -- take anyone you can get, and grade on a curve Before designing your own site, test a live, comparable site to see what works and what doesn't. "Get it" testing checks if the user understands the site's value proposition from the home page without further navigation. â€œKey task" testing assigns the user a task, and observing the steps taken. Allow the user some choice in the task. Just try something else and iterate. When triaging, ignore "kayak problems," where the user goes astray but gets back on track immediately without any help. Good design is a delicate balance, so when fixing a problem, ensure that you aren't introduce new ones

      <h2>Street signs and Breadcrumbs</h2>
	  <p> plea won't use your web site if they can't find their way around it. Search-dominant users will look for the search box first. The home page is important because it is a fixed place, always able to give the user a fresh start. Persistent navigation is the set of navigation elements that appear on every page, except the home page and forms. Make the search box a simple box with no options but allow limiting the scope of the search on the page of results. Every web page needs a name that matches the words clicked to get there. Subtlety is one of the traits of sophisticated design, but users are in such a hurry they miss subtle cues. Make breadcrumbs small and at the very top of a page, where they don't interfere with the primary navigation. Don't substitute the last, boldfaced item in the breadcrumbs list for a page name that frames the content. An active tab should be a different color and physically connect with the space below it so it "pops" to the front. Have a tab selected when the user enters the web site. Every site should have a clearly identifiable site ID, page name, sections, local navigation, "you are here" indicator, and search box. Always avoid stacking underlined text links, as they are hard to read.
